  caption: The first three successive partial Fourier series (shown in red) for a
    square wave (shown in blue). The second half of the course is devoted to Fourier
    series and Fourier integrals. (Image by user [Jim.belk](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fourier_Series.svg)

  image-alt: Three graphs, showing successive partial Fourier series of a square wave,
    overlayed onto the original square wave. Each successive Fourier series more closely
    resembles the original square wave.
