  caption: The first three successive partial Fourier series (shown in red) for a
    square wave (shown in blue). The second half of the course is devoted to Fourier
    series and Fourier integrals. (Image by user {{% resource_link "f0785d5e-1069-4d93-ac30-08bf5acb0feb"

    overlayed onto the original square wave. Each successive Fourier series more closely
    resembles the original square wave.
